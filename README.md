Project Title: RestaurantQ

Project Description:
We have a world restaurant website that presents the user with a home page, menu order page, and a reservations page. Each of these web pages are interactive with one another, allowing to move from page to page. The home page presents the user with a display of the restaurant and buttons to send the user to either the menu order page or reservations page. On the menu order page, the user is shown a list of items to order from. Since anyone in the world can order from the menu, a currency calculator calculates the cost of the USD menu items to European Euro (EUR), Japanese Yen (JPY), British Pound (GBP), Swiss Franc (CHF), Canadian Dollar (CAD), Australian/New Zealand Dollar, South African Rand (ZAR), and other currencies. The currency calculator uses local storage to store the cost and ordered item. The reservations page shows the layout of the restaurant, an entry for the customer name, and an entry for the customer phone number. Phone numbers are required for the applications text messaging service used to alert the user for typical wait times and to confirm their order placed from the menu. Orders placed for bar appetizers or pickup.
